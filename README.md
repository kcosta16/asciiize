# asciiize

asciiize is a simple Python module which replaces characters of various
non-ascii encodings in strings with their nearest ASCII substitute.  For
example, CP1252 curly double quotes (commonly found on text authored with
Word, for example) will be replaced with normal ASCII double quotes. 
Unicode characters with accent marks will be replaced with the
nearest-looking ASCII character with no accent mark.

# Examples

Perform an Nmap scan on your desired target:

```
H채s 창ccents
```

is converted to:

```
Has accents
```

# Usage

```
>>> from asciiize import *
>>> s='H채s 창ccents'
>>> sanitize(s)
'Has accents'
```

The sanitize_multiline function will preserve tabs and line breaks.
